# Rewrite (WIP)

A tool for directed graph rewriting, harnessing the power of dependent types for rule verification, with Idris2.
It supports simple rewrite rules, negative properties, interfaces and typed graphs.

The motivation and the experiences behind this work are documented in my thesis: _Verified Graph Rewriting: Dependent types in general programming_.
